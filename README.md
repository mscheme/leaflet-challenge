Instructions for this assignment can be found at HW_instructions.md

This assignment utilized leftlet.js and geoJson objects to create a map to display recent earthquakes.
Markers placed on the map are placed based on the coordinates in the geoJson data.
Additionally the magnitude of the earthquake determines the size and color of the marker.
